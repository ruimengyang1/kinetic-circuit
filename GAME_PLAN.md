# Clockwork Relay design

## Design reconstruction

The earliest Clockwork Tower brief favored a connected movement stage, rebound
combat, and varied hazards. Its later target-dash chains added skillful aiming
but made enemies disposable steps in a prescribed sequence. Their directional
target cue survives as feedback for the current free dash, without homing. The
gray-box kinetic experiment found a stronger relationship: a threatening ram
can launch, reverse, or rescue the same carriage. Wind Effigy's earlier notes
also argued for momentum that remains legible after a player releases control,
optional upper approaches with safe recovery below, and a human playtest before claiming
that a reachable route is fun. This design keeps those principles without
restoring the tether, health attrition, isolated crushers, or extra levels.

## Core verbs and rules

Run, jump, aim a free dash, and strike downward. Four main mechanics compose:
fixed rebound, kinetic ram, rail carriage, and a shutter that only a moving ram
can open. The player learns the rebound safely, uses a dash across a recoverable
gap, redirects a ram through the shutter, catches the carriage, then decides
whether to redirect an opposing ram or let it reverse the carriage. A rail-stop
return is a second valid outcome. Reversing the advanced carriage deploys the
exit. The same carriage becomes the final rebound tool.

The target is a focused first-play sequence of roughly three to five minutes
including observation and retries. A practiced route should be much faster;
do not lengthen it with empty travel or new standalone hazards. This timing is
a design target pending human playtesting, not an automated result.

## Promise

Build a short precision-platforming route in which one understandable kinetic
rule repeatedly changes meaning:

> A downward strike or directional dash transfers horizontal motion. Rams and
> the carriage keep that motion until friction, another impact, or a rail stop
> changes it.

Contact with a ram is lethal unless the player is actively striking or dashing
it. A confirmed interaction always separates the player safely and refreshes
the dash. The result should progress from threat, to understood rule, to
deliberate tool.

## Continuous learning arc

1. A safe clock pad and an unreachable ledge establish the fixed rebound.
2. A recoverable gap demonstrates the free directional dash without killing a
   player who misses it.
3. A charging ram initially threatens the player. Redirecting or vaulting it
   sends the same ram through a kinetic shutter and into a carriage.
4. The carriage can be caught, ridden, dashed, or struck. A work island keeps a
   missed catch playable.
5. An opposing ram reverses the carriage if left dangerous. Its windup commits
   to a visible direction, so the player can bait its timing or redirect it
   away from the carriage. Redirecting it lets the carriage reach its rail stop
   instead; both shared-rule outcomes create a return.
   An optional upper deck reached by rebounding from the carriage lets the
   player cross above the ram, drop behind it, and dash it back into the
   carriage. This reuses the learned rebound and kinetic transfer rules.
6. The reversal deploys the exit gantry. A downward strike on the returning
   carriage inherits its motion and reaches the bell.

## Hard playability constraints

- Run, jump, dash, and rebound inputs use generous collision windows; successful
  kinetic hits cannot become delayed contact deaths. A ground dash must travel
  across a floor instead of stopping on floor contact.
- Spike collision begins at the visible spike line.
- The first missed dash falls into a recoverable pocket, and the first missed
  carriage catch lands on a work island.
- Death returns in 0.28 seconds. Checkpoints restore a useful, solvable machine
  state rather than a broken or already-lost timing state.
- No mandatory jump depends on a frame-perfect edge input. The complete route
  is exercised by an input-only automated playthrough.
- The optional upper approach has a safe landing behind the ram and works with
  several jump-to-strike and counter-dash timings.

## Scope

The target is one polished continuous route, not multiple disconnected levels.
Cosmetic enemy variants, health attrition, lock-on target chains, a second
shutter, and single-room debug diagnostics are outside the playable design
because they widen the game without deepening the kinetic rule.
